      <h1>Dear Git,</h1>
      <h3>We've finally made it,</h3>
      <p>O backbone of GitHub. Even though you're intimidating to the command-line newbie<br>
      you've saved my life on multiple occasions when <br>
      one mistake I make breaks all my code <br>
      and wow, version control. I can just roll back a commit and start afresh. Thanks. Tell me what you think about this tutorial I've written up.</p>
      <h3>As far as setting up goes</h3>
      <p>I'm assuming Git is already downloaded and usable from the command line. <br>
        Let's work on some setting configurations. Git needs to know your name right? Open up that command line. <br>
        <code>
          git config --global user.name "My Name"<br>
          git config --global user.email myemail@provider.com<br>
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>Navigate to the repository you want version control on --
        Git, let's <strong>git init</strong> a repo locally. So now we've made <br>
        your local repo a Git repo. Meanwhile, find your friend GitHub and make a repository <em>with the same name</em> on there.<br>
        If your repository is empty,
        <ul>
          <li>Simply create a file and add to your repo (like a README). We'll cover commit & pushing later.</li>
        </ul>
        Otherwise,
        <ul>
          <li>Add a remote using <br>
          <code>git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/yourreponame.git <br>
          git push -u origin master
          </code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>You can check the status of the modifications you've made to your repo using <br>
      <code>git status</code> <br>
      You sure you like that? Sweet, let's...</p>
      <h3>Get ready to commit</h3>
      <p>Well what exactly is this elusive "commit" thing everyone talks about? You can think of it as saving something formally -- yeah, you've saved your files, but this time you approve of the changes and would like to give it a little ID and timestamp.</p>

      <h3>Branching</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>git branch</li>
          <li>git checkout [paste hash]</li>
          <li>git check -b [newbranchname] </li>
          <li>git merge [branchname you made changes on]</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Committing & Pushing</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>stuff you know</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>do I really want to go here</li>
          <li>Google is your friend. StackOverflow also.</li>
      </ul>
