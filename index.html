      <h1>Dear Git,</h1>
      <h3 id="about">We've finally made it,</h3>
      <p>O backbone of GitHub. Even though you're intimidating to the command-line newbie<br>
      you've saved my life on multiple occasions when <br>
      one mistake I make breaks all my code <br>
      and wow, version control. I can just roll back a commit and start afresh. Thanks. Tell me what you think about this tutorial I've written up.</p>
      <h3>As far as setting up goes</h3>
      <p>I'm assuming Git is already downloaded and usable from the command line. <br>
        Let's work on some setting configurations. Git needs to know your name right? Open up that command line. <br>
        <code>
          git config --global user.name "My Name"<br>
          git config --global user.email myemail@provider.com<br>
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>Navigate to the repository you want version control on --
        Git, let's <strong>git init</strong> a repo locally. So now we've made <br>
        your local repo a Git repo. Meanwhile, find your friend GitHub and make a repository <em>with the same name</em> on there.<br>
        If your repository is empty,
        <ul>
          <li>Simply create a file and add to your repo (like a README). We'll cover commit & pushing later.</li>
        </ul>
        Otherwise,
        <ul>
          <li>Add a remote using <br>
          <code>git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/yourreponame.git <br>
          git push -u origin master
          </code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>You can check the status of the modifications you've made to your repo using <br>
      <code>git status</code> <br>
      You sure you like that? Sweet, let's...</p>
      <h3>Get ready to commit</h3>
      <p>Well what exactly is this elusive "commit" thing everyone talks about? You can think of it as saving something formally -- yeah, you've saved your files, but this time you approve of the changes and would like to give it a little ID and timestamp.<br>
      Which means down the road when you do something catastrophic to your program or project, you can find the last working commit and revert your code!</p>
      <p><strong> So commit early and often. Use your best judgement as to what "often" means.</strong> <br>
      Oh wait. You need the command. Right. <br>
      <code>git commit -m "Your commit message here"</code><br>
      Keep that line short and sweet (and descriptive) so you can easily look through your commit history to find things you changed or added.</p>

      <h3>Then push!</h3>
      <p>Ok, so you've committed your code, but GitHub doesn't know that because you've done that all locally. It's not a good idea to keep secrets between Git and GitHub, they're friends after all. Let GitHub know you've committed changes by <br>
      <code> git add filenamehere <br>
      git push
      </code><br>
      At this point, Git may prompt you for your username and password. To speed up this process later on, you can set keys specific to you computer so you aren't prompted each time.</p>

      <h3>To experiment with tentative changes,</h3>
      <p>You can create a <strong>git branch</strong> using <br>
      <code>git checkout -b mybranchname</code> <br>
      This will automatically switch you your newest branch. Think of it as your sandbox -- any changes you make here will not be reflected on your master branch. Break things, write infinite loops, improve your code, whatever. </p>
      <p>When you're ready to merge your branched changes to your master branch, <br>
      <code>git branch    # checks which branch you're on <br>
      git merge mybranchname    # merges mybranchname onto master branch</code>
      <p>And there you have it! Basic branching. If you want to switch between branches, simply <strong>git checkout branchname</strong></p>

      <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
      <p>Not much to say here except that Google is your friend.<br>
      Especially everything in the realm of resets and merge conflicts.</p>

      <h4>Fifty cheers for command lines and version control,</h4><br>
