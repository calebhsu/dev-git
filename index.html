      <h1>Dear Git,</h1>

      <!-- About -->
      <h3 id="about">We've finally made it,</h3>
      <p>O backbone of GitHub. Even though you're intimidating to the command-line newbie<br>
      you've saved my life on multiple occasions when <br>
      one mistake I make breaks all my code <br>
      and wow, version control. I can just roll back a commit and start afresh. Thanks. Tell me what you think about this tutorial I've written up.</p>

      <!-- Start -->
      <h3 id="start">As far as setting up goes</h3>
      <p>I'm assuming Git is already downloaded and usable from the command line. <br>
        Let's work on some setting configurations. Git needs to know your name right? Open up that command line. <br>
        <code>git config --global user.name "My Name"</code><br>
        <code>git config --global user.email myemail@provider.com</code>
      </p>
      <p>Navigate to the repository you want version control on --
        Git, let's <strong>git init</strong> a repo locally. So now we've made <br>
        your local repo a Git repo. Meanwhile, find your friend GitHub and make a repository <em>with the same name</em> on there.<br>
        If your repository is empty,
        <ul>
          <li>Simply create a file and add to your repo (like a README). We'll cover commit & pushing later.</li>
        </ul>
        Otherwise,
        <ul>
          <li>Add a remote using <br>
          <code>git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/yourreponame.git</code><br>
          <code>git push -u origin master</code>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>You can check the status of the modifications you've made to your repo using <br>
      <code>git status</code> <br>
      You sure you like that? Sweet, let's...</p>

      <!-- Commit -->
      <h3 id="commit">Get ready to commit</h3>
      <p>Well what exactly is this elusive "commit" thing everyone talks about? <br>
       You can think of it as saving something formally -- yeah, you've saved your files, but this time you approve of the changes and <br>
       would like to give it a little ID and timestamp.<br>
      Which means down the road when you do something catastrophic to your program or project, you can find the last working commit and revert your code!</p>
      <p><strong> So commit early and often. Use your best judgement as to what "often" means.</strong></p>

      <p>Oh wait. You need the command. Right. <br>
      <code>git commit -m "Your commit message here"</code><br>
      Keep that line short and sweet (and descriptive) so you can easily look through your commit history to find things you changed or added.</p>

      <!-- Push -->
      <h3 id="push">Then push!</h3>
      <p>Ok, so you've committed your code, but GitHub doesn't know that because you've done that all locally. <br>
       It's not a good idea to keep secrets between Git and GitHub, they're friends after all. <br>
       Let GitHub know you've committed changes by <br>
      <code> git add filenamehere</code><br>
      <code>git push</code><br>
      At this point, Git may prompt you for your username and password. To speed up this process later on, you can set keys specific to you computer <br>
      so you aren't prompted each time.</p>

      <!-- Branch -->
      <h3 id="branch">To experiment with tentative changes,</h3>
      <p>You can create a <strong>git branch</strong> using <br>
      <code>git checkout -b mybranchname</code> <br>
      This will automatically switch you your newest branch. Think of it as your sandbox -- any changes you make here <br>
      will not be reflected on your master branch. Break things, write infinite loops, improve your code, whatever. </p>
      <p>When you're ready to merge your branched changes to your master branch, <br>
      <code>git branch    # checks which branch you're on</code><br>
      <code>git merge mybranchname    # merges mybranchname onto master branch</code>
      <p>And there you have it! Basic branching. If you want to switch between branches, simply <strong>git checkout branchname</strong></p>

      <h3 id="trouble">Troubleshooting</h3>
      <p>Not much to say here except that Google is your friend.<br>
      Especially everything in the realm of resets and merge conflicts.</p>

      <h4>Fifty cheers for command lines and version control,</h4><br>
